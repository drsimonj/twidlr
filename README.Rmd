# twidlr: data.frame-first formula-second modelling <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />


## Overview

twidlr is an R package that exposes **data.frame-first formula-second** versions of modelling functions. All modelling functions exposed by twidlr are of the following format:

> model_function(data = data.frame, formula = y ~ x's, ...)

twidlr gets its name from the "tilde", often called a "twiddle", used in R formulas.

## Installation

twidlr is available to install from github by running:

```{r, eval = F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("drsimonj/twidlr")
```

## Usage

`library(twidlr)` will expose modelling functions that you're already familiar with, but such that they accept a data frame, formula, and additional arguments!

For example, a typical linear model would be `lm(hp ~ mpg * wt, mtcars, ...)`. Once `twidlr` is loaded, the same model would be run via `lm(mtcars, hp ~ mpg * wt, ...)`.

## Motivation

- Introduce consistency to the API of modelling functions (helping to improve the generality of tidy modelling packages like [piplearner](https://github.com/drsimonj/pipelearner))
- Make modelling functions play nice with [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) tools (e.g., by working with data frames and being pipeable such as`mtcars %>% lm(hp ~ wt)`)
- Leverage formula operators where they may not originally be available. For example, `glmnet(iris, Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Width * Petal.Length + Species)` to fit a generalized linear model with an interaction and automatically dummy-coded factor variable (`Species`).

## twidlr models

data.frame-first formula-second model functions exposed by twidlr:

```{r, echo = F}
x <- data.frame(rbind(
  c(Package = "stats", Function = "lm"),
  
  # Add new model functions here as c("Package", "Function") ------ >
  c("xgboost", "xgboost"),
  c("glmnet", "glmnet"),
  c("stats", "glm"),
  c("rpart", "rpart")
  
  # < ---------------------------------------------------------------
))

knitr::kable(x[order(x$Package, x$Function), ], row.names = FALSE)
```
